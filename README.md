# WorkManagingApp

## This is a current WIP 

The idea for the app is to create a micro freelance solution, 
-The Manage section lets you create a job with a description, cost and time window.
-The Work section lets you know of nearby available microjobs (currently blank)

No google info.plist available (to avoid security issues for the database) but you can setup a new database in your firebase account.
